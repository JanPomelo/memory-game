# F1 Memory Card Game

## Description

This project is a memory game with all the current 20 F1 drivers of the 2023 F1 season. The goal of the game is to click every card just once in order to win the game. When clicking on the [preview](https://f1-memory-game.vercel.app/) you will be greeted by a starting screen where you can choose between three difficulties which are represented by the tyre types of the F1 2023 season. Soft (5 Cards), Medium (10 Cards) and Hard (20 Cards).

### Motivation & Lessons Learned

This project was done for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum in the React Course, where the task was to build a memory game. The focus during this project was on learning and getting familiar with React Hooks, especially the useEffect Hook.
Moreover, I used Interfaces for the first time to handle PropTypes, which offered a better structure and a cleaner code.
Furthermore, it was a good refresher on how to handle API calls.

### Tools used

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite.js

### Future Implementations

- Different Seasons to choose from
